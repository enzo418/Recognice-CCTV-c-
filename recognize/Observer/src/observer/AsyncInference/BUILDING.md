## Troubleshooting

### File generated by a newer protoc version
If you see an error like this but with a preinstalled gRPC, you might have two different version of gRPC. To fix it change the include path to the same as the protoc target.

For example if i installed grpc at `$HOME/.local` the include should be `$HOME/.local/include`:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-isystem\ $HOME/.local/include
```
