# Recognize
## **What is this?**
It started as a multi-platform program to alert about movement and people on cameras. And now it is the same but with several configurations to achieve that goal. These settings are made from a configuration file or from the graphical interface.

## **Content**
The repository includes both the program that performs the recognition alerts and others, which is located in the folder "recognize". But it also has in the /src folder the files for the graphics configuration program.
You can compile "recognize" alone and run it with its parameters and it will work, that folder includes a CMakeLists.txt for that purpose. Although you can also compile the whole repository with the CMakeLists.txt from the root folder and use it from there.
